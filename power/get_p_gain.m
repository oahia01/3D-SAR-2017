% Processing gain is the gain you get from integrating many radar pulses
% taken at a specific location. With more pulses taken at a given location,
% the SNR is lowered at the cost of requiring a slower flight time.
% 
% Processing gain is a linear function based on the pulse integration
% index (pii). A large pii yields a larger processing gain.
