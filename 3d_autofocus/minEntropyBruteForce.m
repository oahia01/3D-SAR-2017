% Minimum Entropy Auto Focus
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------- %
% Entropy is a measure of image intensity. When a radar image is formed
% from out of phase pulse returns, the image is corrupted and entropy
% increases.The goal of minimum entropy auto focus is to find the phase 
% correction for each pulse return that minimizes the overall entropy of 
% the image. 
% 
% The algorithm works as follows: 
%       1 - One pulse at a time, find the phase offset that minimizes the
%           overall entropy of the image. This is currently done using
%           brute force. 
%       2 - Recalculate the image and entropy using the new pulse phase
%           offsets.
%       3 - Iterate. 
%
% The function argument pulseSet is a 4D Matrix of radar pulse returns.
%
%  Dimension:
%     1:3 - The 3D image that corresponds to each given pulse individaully
%       4 - The pulses themselves
%
%  To create the full radar image, sum pulseSet along the 4th dimension.
%
% The second argument is the number of iterations to perform. Each
% iteration will focus the image slightly more, however there is a rate of
% diminishing returns. 
%
% TODO: 
%       1 - Coordinate descent will converge far faster than any brute 
%           force method. This needs to be implemented. We had hang ups 
%           with determining the correct complex derivative for the 
%           coordinate descent function. Consulting the math department 
%           should help. 
%       2 - The phase offset for each pulse in a given iteration is 
%           calculated independently of all the others. This algorithm can 
%           easily be parallelized.
